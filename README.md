# addressbook

*[It's been quite a long time since I created this yet-another-contact-manager. At that point, I had been tinkering with Python - and programming in general - for a few months. This little project is a mashup of everything I'd learnt. Hopefully, I've made progress since then. Nevertheless, I've decided not to delete this repo and leave it as it is - to serve as a remainder of my humble beginnings.]*

AddressBook is a simple contact manager that helps to keep track of your contacts, including email addresses, phones, addresses and birthdays. It enables users to create their own address books, save them (in pickle format) and restore data from existing ones. Options include adding, modifying and removing entries, as well as sorting and searching through them.

This version requires Python 3 or later.

This project is my first humble foray into programming - it was created solely for the sake of learning Python and wasn't intended for real-life application. I'm perfectly aware of its numerous flaws and open to advice and suggestions.


Things to do:

- enable storing (and retrieving) data from address books using SQL
